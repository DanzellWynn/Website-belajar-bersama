    <h2>📚 Theory</h2>
    <p>Reported speech is used to report what someone has said without quoting the exact words.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Direct: He said, "I am happy."</li>
      <li>Reported: He said that he was happy.</li>
      <li>Change of tense is needed depending on reporting verb.</li>
    </ul>
